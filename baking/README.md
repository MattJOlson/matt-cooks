# Baking

I mostly bake yeasted doughs, mostly breads, mostly with preferments. In
this document I'm writing about how I approach baking in general;
recipes will come later.

## Mindset

Baking is different than cooking, especially on the stovetop, but two
principles remain: never let the food win, and even your mistakes will
probably be edible. I let the idea of baking intimidate me for years,
which means I spent years needlessly eating mediocre bread. Don't be
like Past Matt.

### Patience and experimentation

Unlike stovetop cooking, many of your decisions in baking take hours or
even days to pay off. That makes it more important to bring a mindset
of experimentation: what are you going to try, what do you expect to
happen, how do you think it'll work. Writing stuff down is a bit more
important when baking than when cooking, but not overwhelmingly so.

#### Details matter, but not all at once

There's all kinds of things you can focus on when baking: dough
temperature, room temperature, how much yeast, how much hydration,
how much protein in your flour, whether you did an autolyse and for
how long, how many folds and how long between each... just an awful lot
of decisions to make that won't show up, if at all, until hours later
when the bread has cooled and you cut into it.

That makes it tempting to try to keep track of _all the things_ and pore
over them later to figure out why your loaf overproofed or your crumb
ended up dense. Resist the temptation. Start with a recipe you like,
bake it once or twice to get a feel for how it works as written - hang
on, I have a digression:

So once you have a baseline for how a particular bread should work, you
can start tracking _some of_ the details that you'd like to experiment
with. Maybe you've read that higher hydration will make a more open
crumb (which you'd like) -- try raising the hydration a few percent and
see what happens. This is a slow development process, and sometimes a
frustrating one when your changes don't pan out as you'd have liked, but
your intermediate steps are probably still going to be awfully good
compared to what you'd get from the store. As you go, changing one or
maybe two things at a time, you'll get a sense for what works.

#### Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing

Both gluten and yeast develop on their own schedules, not yours. This
can be frustrating, or an enormous relief, depending on how you approach
it (and one approach is to plan your baking well in advance, so you're
not in a frantic rush to get something in the oven or on the table).

Generally speaking, the longer you can ferment your dough, the more
flavour it'll develop. (Go too far and you'll discover that _more_ does
not necesarily imply _better_, but that takes several days and you're
unlikely to do it by accident.) There are several ways to achieve this
without your yeast eating all the starches it can find: you can make a
preferment with just a little bit of yeast; you can bulk ferment your
dough in the refrigerator overnight; you can proof your dough in the
fridge, too. Making a sourdough starter and building levains from it is
maybe the logical conclusion of "take longer and build flavour", if you
don't mind having a pet that needs feeding on a stricter schedule than
any cat I've met. But in general, you can slow the yeast down (if you
need to) by putting the dough in the fridge.

Gluten also runs on its own schedule, although it's easier to speed up
than yeast. You can, if you want, bully a dough into developing gluten
by throwing it in a food processor or a stand mixer on high, but an
overworked dough is an unpleasant thing to try to shape. On the other
hand, give a wet, shaggy ball of flour and water an hour to autolyse,
and you end up with something much more compliant on the other side;
give a tight, bouncy preshaped dough ball twenty minutes to relax, and
it becomes much easier to shape into a loaf or bun. Often I find the
best response to misbehaving dough is to ignore it for half an hour.

And at last -- when you've baked your loaves and your kitchen smells
amazing and they come out of the oven crackling, the crumb needs to cool
to set, and cutting right in won't do you any favours. Depending on your
baking schedule, this can be infuriating in that bread you bake tonight
might not be ready to eat until _tomorrow_. That is, to me, just part of
the process.
