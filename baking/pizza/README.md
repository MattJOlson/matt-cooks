# Skillet-broiler pizza dough (40% biga)

This recipe, and method, began when I saw a chance to make thin-crust
pizza a reasonable working-from-home lunch. I'm going to focus on the
dough, which makes five portions about suitable for an 8" diameter
pizza. I'm also going to touch on the cooking method, which gets me
fairly high-quality pizzas (by my own standards, probably not to a
Neapolitan pizzaiolo) in a standard apartment oven. I'm _not_ going to
talk about sauces or toppings, at least not here.

Originally I was shooting for "B+ results with C- effort"; I think now
I'm getting A- results for C+ effort.

### Base recipe

I started working off the [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/hacker-free-neapolitan-pizza-for-a-home-kitchen-recipe)
skillet-broiler pizza method.

## Equipment

The only uncommon pieces of equipment I use are a carbon-steel skillet
(cast iron would be fine, something broiler-safe and seasoned) and a
digital kitchen scale. Otherwise it's just mixing bowls, kitchen towels,
and a rolling pin.

## Timeline

- Biga: 10-14h
  - This will depend on your kitchen (or home) temperature, and you have
    about an hour or two of leeway once the biga fully matures.
- Autolyse and mix: 2-3h
- Bulk ferment: Overnight, a day or so is fine
- Shaping and proofing: 2-3h
- Topping and baking: 5-6min (yes, minutes)

I usually mix the biga before work on a weekday morning, let it ferment
during the day, and mix the dough in the evening. I'll bulk ferment the
dough in the fridge overnight, shape it mid-afternoon (work permitting),
freeze four portions, and proof the last (and cook it for dinner). Then
I'll pull a portion out of the freezer the night before I want to cook
it, start proofing it around 9:30am, and cook around noon.

## Prep list

### Totals (375g: 100%)

- 150g all-purpose flour (about 13% protein) (40%)
- 150g "tipo 00"-style pizza flour (about 10% protein) (40%)
- 75g whole-wheat flour\* (20%)
- 6g salt (1.6%)
- 3g instant yeast (0.8%)
- 3g sugar (0.8%)
- 260g water at around 75degF (~70% hydration)
- 7.5g vital wheat gluten (2%)

This hasn't changed much since I started messing with the recipe, and
it's probably to a point where I can start playing around with stuff. I
changed out some of the pizza flour for AP mostly as a convenience move
(I tend to keep a lot of AP in my pantry, and it costs less and comes in
bigger bags than the pizza flour), and added 20% whole wheat for flavour
and texture. (There's a \* by the whole wheat instead of a protein %age
because I haven't settled on a whole-wheat flour I really like yet.)

The vital wheat gluten is there to help the high-ish hydration dough
develop strength, and so the fairly thin crust stays stiff instead of
flopping over and dumping its load of cheese and sauce into your lap. I
might be able to get away without it if I increase the ratio of AP to 00
flour (getting more protein from the flour itself).

### Biga (150g: 40%)

- 75g AP flour
- 75g whole-wheat flour
- 95g water at around 75degF (~63% hydration)
- a pinch of instant yeast

"A pinch" isn't the most useful measurement; get a 1/4tsp measure and
imagine a bit less than a quarter of that. Use a bit more yeast if your
home or your tap water is cold, and a bit less if it's hot. Also use a
bit more yeast if you want your biga to develop more quickly, and a bit
less if you want it to develop more slowly.

### Autolyse / the rest (225g: 60%)

- 75g AP flour
- 150g 00 pizza flour
- 7.5g vital wheat gluten (2%)
- 165g water at around 75degF (~71% hydration)

- 6g salt (1.6%)
- 3g instant yeast (0.8%)
- 3g sugar (0.8%)

## Method

Note that the biga, and the dough during its bulk ferment, should be
sealed airtight (e.g. with a tight-fitting lid or plastic wrap), while
the autolyse and any resting dough can be covered with a clean dish
towel (or loose piece of plastic wrap).

### 1. Make the biga

- Using a scale, measure the flours into a mixing bowl
- Add the yeast and mix well with a dough whisk, spoon, or by hand
- Put the bowl back on the scale, zero it out, and add water
- Mix the water into the dough with a dough whisk, spoon, spatula, or by
  hand until thoroughly combined. Knead it in the bowl a little to make
  sure all the flour is well-hydrated and no dry spots remain
- Press the dough ball (biga) into a clean 4cu deli container, or other
  sealable bowl or container at least three times the biga's volume
- Seal airtight and let sit at room temperature for 10-14h, until the
  biga has increased in volume by about 2.5x, and the top has domed and
  just started to flatten or collapse on itself. You'll have about 1-2h
  to use the biga at this point at its peak flavour; if you need more
  time, put the ripe biga in a cold part of the refrigerator until ready

### 2. Autolyse the remaining flour

- Using a scale, measure the flours and vital wheat gluten into a mixing
  bowl and mix well to combine
- Add the water and mix until thoroughly combined. _Do not_ add the
  yeast, salt, or sugar
- Cover and let sit at room temperature for about an hour

### 3. Mix the dough

- Using a scale, measure the salt, yeast, and sugar into a small bowl or
  deli container
- Uncover the autolyse and flatten it somewhat. Sprinkle the salt,
  yeast, and sugar over the autolysed flour
- Wet your hand slightly and scoop the biga out of its container onto a
  work surface. Using a dough scraper or your hands, cut or tear it into
  small pieces about an inch in diameter. Toss those onto the autolyse
- Wetting your hand as necessary to avoid flour sticking, scoop up under
  one edge of the autolyse, pull it up and over the dry ingredients and
  pieces of biga, and place it down. Rotate the bowl a bit and repeat,
  pressing down to distribute the stuff in the middle once it won't
  squirt out the side, until fully incorporated _or_ until the dough
  tightens up too much to properly stretch. Cover and let sit for about
  20min
- About every 20min over the next 1-2h, uncover the dough, and repeat
  the folding process with a wetted hand. This further mixes the biga
  and autolyse, and develops gluten structure without overworking the
  dough. You're done when the dough "windowpanes" - that is, when you
  can stretch it between your fingers until it's somewhat translucent
  without the dough tearing. If you go more than about an hour and a
  half and the dough still doesn't windowpane, it's okay to stop there

### 4. Bulk ferment

- Lightly oil a container a bit more than twice the size of the dough
  with olive oil (or any cooking fat really)
- Drop the mixed dough into the container and seal it airtight
- Place the container in the fridge for at least eight hours and up to a
  day; you want it to about double in size

### 5. Portion and shape

- Cut a small piece of parchment paper to cover your scale
- Flour your work surface and the top of the bulk-fermented dough, and
  turn the dough out onto the work surface. Dust it with flour (use only
  as much as you need to stop it from sticking) and weigh it; you should
  get about 625g of dough, maybe a bit more.
- Using a dough scraper, divide the dough into six equal portions. How
  precise you want to get is up to you; on the one hand you have a scale
  _right there_; on the other hand you don't want to hack up the dough
  into _too_ many pieces. Try to balance things out such that you aren't
  assembling more than three or four pieces of dough into a portion
- Flour your hands and take a portion of dough, pressing any smaller
  pieces into the middle of the large piece. Using the fingers of one
  hand, tuck the dough up and underneath to ball it up, with the other
  hand holding the portion steady. You're trying to create tension on
  the top / outside of the dough ball; this creates a skin. (This is a
  more important step for buns or loaves of bread than for pizza, but it
  doesn't hurt)
- Once you've achieved a ball with an open seam / hole on the bottom,
  cup your hand over it and roll it around on the work surface, seam side
  down, in just enough flour so that it doesn't stick and tear. This will
  largely close up the seam; we're going to be flattening these out hard
  with a rolling pin so perfection is _not_ required
- Dust a corner of your work surface with flour, place the ball down on
  it, dust the top lightly with a bit more flour, and cover. Repeat with
  the other four portions

### 5a. Freeze any portions you aren't going to cook right away

- Take four of the portions and wrap them in plastic wrap, with the
  edges of the plastic wrap on the seam side
- Place those portions on a small baking sheet (eighth sheet) in the
  freezer until frozen through, then transfer to a freezer bag
- To defrost, take one portion out of the freezer the night before,
  unwrap it, and place it in a lightly oiled sealed container overnight.
  Remove the container from the fridge about 2.5h before you plan to
  cook it, and proceed as below

### 6. Proof and shape

- Let the portion proof on the work surface (in its container or on the
  floured corner you made) for about two hours
- Flour about a one foot square section of your work surface and turn
  the dough portion out onto it, dusting both sides
- Using your fingertips, gently stretch the dough ball into a disk about
  four to six inches in diameter
- Put the disk on the work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll it out
  to about eight or nine inches in diameter. You'll need to dust the
  dough with flour (it'll tend to stick on the edges). If you don't roll
  out all the way to the edges of the disk and stop about half an inch
  short, you'll get a bit of a crown
- The disk you end up with is probably not going to be perfectly round;
  use your fingertips to stretch it into a more uniform shape
- Cover with a towel for about 30min; the dough will continue to proof
  and this is where the crown will rise a bit above the centre

The more you can roll the dough out vs stretching it, the more uniform
your crust will be in thickness. You're trying to avoid stretching the
dough to the point where it tears or windowpanes in the middle; that's a
weak spot that risks leaking sauce.

I am not asking you to shape the dough by hand because this is a "good
results for indifferent effort" kind of recipe. If you _want_ to you
certainly can.

If the dough pops back and resists your efforts to flatten it out to
eight inches, it may be underproofed; let it rest another 15min and try
again. I can't speak to exact numbers but a well-proofed dough will be
pretty easy to extend to the size you want; if it's taking dozens of
strokes with the pin you should probably let it rest a bit.

### 7. Cook

- While the rolled-out dough is proofing (the last 30min), prepare your
  toppings, whatever those are
- Adjust the top rack in your oven such that you can fit your skillet
  on it _just_ underneath the broiler. (If you have a broiler tray
  _under_ your oven, um, best of luck and maybe experiment with a flour
  tortilla or two)
- About 5min before cooking, preheat your broiler to high
- Right away, place your skillet on a burner over medium-high heat and
  add about 2tsp of neutral oil. Brush it around with a silicone pastry
  brush to coat; there should be just a little pool of oil left over
- Uncover your crust and brush the outside (you should see that the
  crown has risen just a bit) with hot oil from the skillet
- Put the skillet back on the burner and wait for it to start smoking
- Once the skillet's smoking, quickly (and as gently as you can)
  transfer the crust into the skillet. With hot oil you should be able
  to reposition it a bit without anything sticking. It will start to
  cook, and bubbles will form; press them down if they're inconvenient
- Place two tablespoons of pizza sauce in the middle of the pie and
  spread it out uniformly
- Scatter cheese over the pizza, again roughly uniformly
- Add your toppings
- Transfer skillet into the oven under the broiler. Turn off the burner
  and put something like a kettle on top to soak up any heat in the
  element (I should mention I have a coil stovetop, this will be less
  of a problem on induction or gas)
- After two minutes, pull out the skillet and check the pizza. You're
  looking for browning; in my oven that doesn't really happen until
  later, but I get better results if I rotate the pizza about halfway
  at this point. Rotate if desired and, if needed, put the pizza back
  under the broiler for another 1-2 minutes or until the crust and
  maybe some of the cheese is browned to your satisfaction
- Remove the skillet to the now-cooled burner and check underneath the
  crust with a fish spatula or something like it. Is the undercarriage
  browned how you like it? If it isn't yet, the skillet probably has
  enough heat in it that you can let it sit there for a minute to brown;
  if it's vastly undercooked, turn that burner back on to help
- Once the pizza's done to your satisfaction, slide it out onto a
  cutting board, cut it into quarters, and serve

I have a mildly precarious setup where I use a cast-iron pan as a spacer
to get my carbon-steel skillet close to the broiler. That means I heat
the cast iron, which puts more energy into the bottom of the carbon
steel, which cooks the bottom of the pizza just fine. If you're not
doing something like that, you may need to finish cooking the bottom of
the pie on the stovetop once the top is cooked under the broiler.

This is (deliberately) not a very thick or robust crust, so you probably
don't want to top it heavily. About 2tbsp of sauce, a bit less cheese
than you think, and a bit less topping than you think works for me.

When topping the pizza, you want to work quickly, but you don't have to
rush through it.

The dough will bubble and blister, mostly around the edges. If it
bubbles more than say an inch into the diameter of the pizza, especially
if it's bubbling in the middle, you probably have underproofed dough.
That won't save this pizza (it'll still be delicious, just uneven), but
keep it in mind for future pizzas from the same batch.
